### Motivation 

The motivation for our project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand the multifactorial dimensions of New York state student health, specifically relating to obesity and overweight prevalence. Our project will seek to establish correlations between access to food availability, demographic variables, and weight status to better understand the impact of social determinants on student health outcomes. Insights gained from this analysis will be instrumental in informing public health interventions, educational policies, and community-based programs to promote healthier lifestyles and address the obesity epidemic in New York state.

### Aim 

Our project will develop a web platform designed for the exploration of intrinsic connections between the weight status of New York state students and their demographic characteristics. A multifaceted correlation analysis will be conducted to comprehensively analyze each demographic variable, including causal inferences, regression analyses, and hypothesis testing. Subsequently, the outcomes will be presented in the form of interactive graphs and tabulated data for enhanced accessibility and clarity. Furthermore, a narrated screencast will provide an intuitive overview of the final product, offering an in-depth understanding of the research findings and their implications.

### Exploratory Analysis

In our exploratory analysis, we employed visualizations to examine the trends in overweight percentages among New York State students from 2015 to 2019. Our findings revealed a relatively stable trend in overweight percentages, with minor fluctuations across the years. County-level analysis highlighted regions with notably high overweight and obese percentages, pinpointing areas such as Oswego County for potential targeted interventions. Further, our visual comparisons between elementary and middle school students across counties indicated a general trend of higher overweight percentages among middle school students. Gender-based analysis revealed that female students were more likely to be overweight than male students. Additionally, our exploration into the racial composition of student populations across counties suggested a correlation between a higher proportion of White students and increased overweight percentages, while a greater presence of Asian, Black, and Hispanic students correlated with lower overweight percentages. 

### Additional Analysis

Two-Sample T-Tests:

Female Students Across Grade Levels: The two-sample t-test revealed a statistically significant difference in the mean log number of overweight female students between elementary and middle/high schools. Elementary schools exhibited a higher mean, suggesting a greater prevalence of overweight conditions among younger female students.

Male Students Across Grade Levels: A similar pattern was observed in male students. The t-test showed a significant difference between elementary and middle/high school male students, with higher mean log numbers of overweight students in elementary schools.

Elementary Students Across Sex Groups: In elementary schools, the t-test indicated no significant difference in the mean log number of overweight students between male and female groups, suggesting similar overweight prevalence across genders at this educational level.

Middle/High School Students Across Sex Groups: For middle/high school students, the t-test also found no significant difference in overweight prevalence between male and female students, highlighting comparable conditions across genders in older student groups.

Regression Analyses:

SLR - Sex vs Percentage of Overweight: This model demonstrated a significant influence of sex on the percentage of overweight students. Male students were found to have a lower percentage of overweight cases than female students, as indicated by the model's negative coefficient for sex.

SLR - Grade Level vs Percent of Overweight: The regression analysis assessing the impact of grade level on overweight percentages revealed that middle/high school students had a higher percentage of overweight students compared to elementary students. This finding suggests that older students are more prone to overweight conditions.

MLR - Grade Level & Sex vs Percent of Overweight: Combining sex and grade level in an MLR model, both factors were shown to significantly influence the percentage of overweight students. This model provided a more comprehensive understanding than the individual SLR analyses.

MLR - Student Demographic Info vs Percent of Overweight: This model analyzed the relationship between student demographics and overweight percentages at the district level. It highlighted a significant but small association between racial composition and overweight percentages, with certain racial groups more affected than others.

MLR - Other Weight Status vs Percent of Overweight: The analysis of the relationship between different weight statuses and the percentage of overweight students showed a very small and statistically insignificant effect of the percentage of healthy weight students on the percentage of overweight students. This points to the complexity of factors influencing overweight prevalence.

MLR - Lunch Type vs Percent of Overweight: The model examining the association between types of lunch and overweight percentages suggested a potential relationship. However, the lack of statistically significant findings indicates the need for further investigation into how nutritional factors contribute to student weight status.

### Discussion

The comprehensive analysis of student health data in New York State has yielded several key insights into the factors influencing the prevalence of overweight and obesity among students. These insights are critical for shaping effective public health strategies and educational interventions.

Impact of Demographic Factors: Our findings highlight the significant role of demographic factors such as sex and grade level in influencing overweight and obesity rates among students. The distinct patterns observed across different grade levels and between male and female students underscore the need for targeted health initiatives that are sensitive to these demographic nuances.

Role of Socio-Cultural Factors: The association between racial composition and overweight percentages, although statistically significant, revealed small effect sizes. This suggests that while racial and socio-cultural factors play a role in student health outcomes, their practical impact might be limited. This calls for a deeper exploration into the complex interplay of socio-cultural dynamics and health behaviors.

Limitations and Future Research Directions: It's important to note the limitations inherent in our study, particularly the observational nature of the data which restricts our ability to draw causal inferences. Future research, possibly incorporating longitudinal studies and experimental designs, could provide more definitive insights into the causal factors influencing student health.

Implications for Policy and Practice: The study's findings have important implications for public health policies and school-based health programs. Tailoring interventions to address the specific needs of different student groups, particularly considering age and gender, could be more effective in mitigating overweight and obesity issues. Additionally, integrating an understanding of socio-cultural influences into health promotion strategies could enhance their effectiveness and inclusivity.

Comprehensive Approach to Student Health: Ultimately, our analysis points to the necessity of a multifaceted approach in addressing the overweight and obesity epidemic among students. This approach should combine public health interventions, educational policies, and community-based programs, all tailored to the unique needs and backgrounds of the student population.
