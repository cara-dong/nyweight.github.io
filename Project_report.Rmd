# Motivation 

The motivation for our project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand the multifactorial dimensions of New York state student health, specifically relating to obesity and overweight prevalence. Our project will seek to establish correlations between access to food availability, demographic variables, and weight status to better understand the impact of social determinants on student health outcomes. Insights gained from this analysis will be instrumental in informing public health interventions, educational policies, and community-based programs to promote healthier lifestyles and address the obesity epidemic in New York state.

# Aim 

Our project will develop a web platform designed for the exploration of intrinsic connections between the weight status of New York state students and their demographic characteristics. A multifaceted correlation analysis will be conducted to comprehensively analyze each demographic variable, including causal inferences, regression analyses, and hypothesis testing. Subsequently, the outcomes will be presented in the form of interactive graphs and tabulated data for enhanced accessibility and clarity. Furthermore, a narrated screencast will provide an intuitive overview of the final product, offering an in-depth understanding of the research findings and their implications.

# Exploratory Analysis

In our exploratory analysis, we employed visualizations to examine the trends in overweight percentages among New York State students from 2015 to 2019. Our findings revealed a relatively stable trend in overweight percentages, with minor fluctuations across the years. County-level analysis highlighted regions with notably high overweight and obese percentages, pinpointing areas such as Oswego County for potential targeted interventions. Further, our visual comparisons between elementary and middle school students across counties indicated a general trend of higher overweight percentages among middle school students. Gender-based analysis revealed that female students were more likely to be overweight than male students. Additionally, our exploration into the racial composition of student populations across counties suggested a correlation between a higher proportion of White students and increased overweight percentages, while a greater presence of Asian, Black, and Hispanic students correlated with lower overweight percentages. 

# Additional Analysis
The additional analysis phase of our project involved conducting both Simple Linear Regression (SLR) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analyses to explore and understand the factors influencing the weight status of students in New York State.

Two-sample T-test

We also conducted a two-sample t-test to compare the average number of overweight female students across different grade levels (elementary and middle/high school). The test revealed a statistically significant difference, suggesting that the grade level significantly influences the prevalence of overweight conditions among female students. This result further underscores the importance of considering educational stages in public health strategies aimed at addressing student overweight and obesity.

SLR - Sex vs Percentage of Overweight:

This model explored the impact of sex on the percentage of overweight students. The results indicated a significant difference between male and female students, with male students generally having a lower percentage of overweight cases. The model's equation was percent_overweight = 17.546446 - 1.177219 * sex, and the negative coefficient for sex (p-value almost 0) suggested a higher percentage of overweight in female students compared to males.

SLR - Grade Level vs Percent of Overweight:

Another SLR model was developed to assess the effect of grade level on overweight percentages. The results showed that middle/high school students had a higher percentage of overweight compared to elementary school students. The model's equation was percent_overweight = 16.126602 - 1.716477 * grade_level, with a significant positive coefficient for grade level, indicating a higher prevalence of overweight in middle/high school levels.

MLR - Grade Level & Sex vs Percent of Overweight:

An MLR model was used to understand the combined effects of sex and grade level. The model showed that both factors were significant determinants of overweight percentage, with the equation being percent_overweight = 16.717571 - -1.179560 * grade_level + 1.718086 * grade_level. The analysis suggested that the MLR model was more informative than individual SLR models.

MLR - Student Demographic Info vs Percent of Overweight:

This MLR analysis focused on the relationship between student demographics and overweight percentages at the district level. The results highlighted a significant, yet small, association between racial composition and overweight percentages. For example, as the percentage of American Indian students increased, so did the percentage of overweight students. However, the practical significance of these findings was limited due to the small effect sizes.

MLR - Other Weight Status vs Percent of Overweight:

In this model, different weight statuses were analyzed against the percentage of overweight students. The results showed a very small, statistically insignificant effect of the percentage of healthy weight students on the percentage of overweight students, indicating the complexity of factors influencing overweight prevalence.

MLR - Lunch Type vs Percent of Overweight:

This model explored the association between types of lunch (free or reduced) and the percentage of overweight students. The results suggested a potential relationship; however, none of the predictors showed a statistically significant relationship, pointing to the need for further research in this area.

# Discussion

Our analysis of student health data in New York State has illuminated several critical aspects of overweight and obesity prevalence among students. The relatively constant overweight percentages over the years indicate a persistent challenge in student health, necessitating continuous public health and educational interventions. Notably, the variation in overweight percentages across counties, and the higher prevalence among female and middle/high school students, highlights the need for targeted health initiatives that address specific demographic needs.

The regression analyses and two-sample t-test results underscore the significant roles of sex, grade level, and racial composition in influencing overweight prevalence. This suggests a multifaceted approach is required in addressing student health, one that encompasses not only biological and behavioral aspects but also socio-cultural considerations.

However, the limitations of our study, particularly in establishing causality, suggest the need for more in-depth research, potentially employing longitudinal data. Overall, our findings provide a foundation for developing nuanced and effective health policies and programs, tailored to the diverse needs of students across New York State.
