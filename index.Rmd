<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 20px;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif;">
Our project aims to tackle the critical issue of obesity and overweight prevalence among students in New York State. By analyzing student health data alongside demographic variables, we seek to understand how social factors impact obesity and overweight rates in this population. Our approach includes various statistical techniques, including regression analysis, to uncover the underlying patterns and correlations. The insights from this study will guide public health strategies and educational policies, aiming to improve student health outcomes and address the obesity challenge in New York State.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 20px;">Findings</h2>
<ul style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif;">
    <li>Stable Overweight Trends: Overweight percentages among New York State students remained relatively stable from 2015 to 2019, indicating a persistent health challenge in student populations.
    <li>Demographic Influences: Significant differences were found in overweight prevalence between male and female students, as well as between different educational levels. Male and elementary school students generally had lower overweight percentages.
    <li>Grade Level Impact: Grade level significantly affected overweight rates, with middle/high school students exhibiting higher percentages of overweight compared to elementary students.
    <li>Combined Effects of Sex and Grade Level: Multiple Linear Regression models revealed that both sex and grade level were significant determinants of overweight percentages, highlighting the need for interventions tailored to these demographic factors.
    <li>Socio-Cultural Factors: Racial composition showed a statistically significant, albeit small, association with overweight percentages at the district level, suggesting the influence of socio-cultural factors on student health outcomes.
    <li>Nutritional Factors: The analysis of lunch types (free or reduced) did not show statistically significant relationships with overweight percentages, pointing to a complex interaction between nutritional factors and student weight status.
