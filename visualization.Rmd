## overweight percentage changes over year

interpretation: This plot looks messy, needs to think about it later

## County level number of percent overweight/obese/healthy
```{r}
# calculate the average percentage of overweight/obsed/healthy for all years
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = county, y = percent_overweight, fill = county)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Percentage Overweight by County",
       x = "County",
       y = "Percentage Overweight",
       fill = "County") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
